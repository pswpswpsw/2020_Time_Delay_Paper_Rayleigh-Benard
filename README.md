# Description

The data is collected by solving 3D incompressible N-S equation in OpenFOAM. Details can be found in the paper. Then, SVD is performed by Nicholas Arnold-Medabalimi. 

Physical parameters:
- Ra = 10^7
- Pr = 1.0


# Data sets

Here are the POD coefficients in the mat file format with different truncations to illustrate the trend of "optimal" delay in the paper.
